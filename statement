Web Dissection

When I was a tiny child of the late 90s/early 2000s, my favorite games were educational CD Roms. 
There were explorative games that were reminiscent
of picture books for children that dissected and explained the components of a place or an object.
 So I created a world utilizing 3DModels
and images to immerse my audience into my interpretation of how HTML files would be organized if
they were tangible. To add to the experience
I created a splash page that leads to the 3js scene. The splash page introduces the audience to
Jiffe the Giraffe. I dithered the original image with classic
font and a shadowed glow behind the bottom text as a nudge to the simple web design of websites
from the early World Wide Web days of the 2000s.
Once you enter the cyberspace and walk past the retro PC, the viewer encounters giant folders
and a filing cabinet that allude to organization of
website files. The viewer can follow paths of "hyperlinks" and walk under cable protectors to visit
the displays of different web files.
